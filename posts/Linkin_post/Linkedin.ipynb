    "# Thoughts: \n",
    "In this interaction, I reached out to Meta AI seeking assistance in crafting a LinkedIn post for accepting a junior consultant internship at a large consulting firm. Initially, Meta AI provided a template for a job advertisement instead, so I clarified that I needed a post for announcing my own acceptance of an internship. Meta AI promptly corrected the direction and supplied a draft emphasizing my gratitude and excitement for the opportunity, including a special mention of my father's role in the firm and his influence on the rigorous interview process.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then requested an adjustment to the post to reflect a more playful tone while subtly acknowledging the nepotism involved. Meta AI adapted the post to be light-hearted, maintaining professionalism but with a humorous acknowledgment of my fatherâ€™s significant presence in the company. It did not do what I had asked and the prompted on my part could have been better to reflect my intention of making it seem like the person was unaware of the privilege they had with their internship opportunity. I made another attempt at this on Bing and that one turned out much better than this one. \n",
