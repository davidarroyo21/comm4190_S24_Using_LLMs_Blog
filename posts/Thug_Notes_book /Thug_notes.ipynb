    "# Thoughts \n",
    "I curious to see if Meta would be able to recreate a script that would sound similar to to the Youtuber Thug Notes. I first chose Great Gatsby because I know Thug Notes has covered this book already and Meta would be able to see what the vocabulary he uses and the type of humorous tone he shows. I usually read some type of children book sires during the summer and last one I chose Percy Jackson and wanted a refresher to what happened in the books. Honestly not too bad of a let down by Meta with the way it showed the Youtuber's voice. One critique which I had was that it used very similar wording for the summaries, which I would have liked to have seen a bit more variance in the speech used or more phrases he usually uses in the summary videos. I could have prompted Meta to do other books to see if it would capture a different tone. \n",
