    "# Original thought process: \n",
    "I love gardening and watching the tiktokers and youtubers who build massive gardens. This was my original interest and I wanted to see how much information Meta would be able to give me based on the large amounts of information on gardening and what it would take to have a large garden. I also wanted to see if it would be able to create a vision of what the garden may look like based on youtubers and the advice it had given me. It gave solid advice on how to garden but it was a bit surface level but I think with more prompting about specific techniques and things it advised it would work out. The photos it created were very interesting, some were very utopian or even like a green house type of enclosed space but I wanted more of a regular garden anyone can have. \n",
